# logistic-regression-examples
A collection of simple Python examples demonstrating Logistic Regression for classification tasks, including tumor prediction and candy dataset analysis.

This repository contains simple Python examples demonstrating **Logistic Regression** using `scikit-learn`. The examples cover:

- Predicting tumor malignancy based on size.
- Analyzing the candy dataset with multiple features.
- Understanding log-odds and converting them to probabilities.

These examples are ideal for beginners who want to learn how logistic regression works in practice.

## Features

1. **Example 1 – Tumor Prediction**
   - Predicts if a tumor is cancerous based on its size.
   - Demonstrates basic fitting and prediction using `LogisticRegression`.

2. **Example 2 – Candy Dataset Analysis**
   - Fits a logistic regression model on a two-feature dataset.
   - Generates predicted probabilities and plots them with a color-coded scatter plot.

3. **Example 3 – Log-Odds and Probability Conversion**
   - Calculates the odds from model coefficients.
   - Converts log-odds into probabilities using a custom function.
